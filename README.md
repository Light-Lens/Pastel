> Its development is ongoing and progressing well, but not all features have been implemented yet. So, if you find any bugs or have any suggestion, feel free to post an _issue_ or a _pull request_.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio Code is recommended, Pastel is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Light-Lens/Pastel`.

## The Plan
The plan for Pastel is to develop a highly efficient and user-friendly object-oriented programming language that can handle a wide range of applications, from graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to game rendering. The language is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing developers to create applications quickly and efficiently.

As an open-source project, it aims to leverage the latest advancements in programming technology and optimize the language for performance through the contributions of a diverse community of developers. The initial plan is to utilize OpenGL for game rendering, however, the project is open to exploring alternative technologies such as DirectX, Vulkan, or others that may offer superior performance or better suit the needs of the project.

The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive and accessible solution for developers, enabling them to create a wide range of applications with ease and efficiency. Whether it's developing a complex game or creating a simple graphical user interface, Pastel is designed to be a versatile and collaborative solution for all your programming needs.
